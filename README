1. To build Orion Viewer from command line you will 
    need android-sdk-r21 and apache-ant 1.8 installed in your system.
2. Change path to android-sdk in orion-viewer/local.properties.
    See orion-viewer/local.properties.sample for example.
3. If you build NOT for Highscreen/Spring Design Alex then comment AlexDevice class
    in orion-viewer/src/universe/constellation/orion/viewer/device/
4. Go to orion-viewer folder (there is ant build script: build.xml)
    and run 'ant' command with 'release' target:
	ant release

For Highscreen Alex:
3.b Select alex target in orion-viewer/project.properties
    or specify 'alex.sdk.dir' property in local.properties
4.b Run command:
    ant -f build_alex.xml release

5. Project building will starts!
