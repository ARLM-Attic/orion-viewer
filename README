To build Orion Viewer you will need:
    android-sdk-r23+
    android-ndk-r9d+
    gradle 1.12+

Specify path to android-sdk in 'local.properties' (use 'local.properties.sample' as example).

All build logic scripted in build.gradle,
but before running it checkout and build native libraries see 'orion-viewer/jni/README' file
