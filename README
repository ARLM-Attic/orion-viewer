To build Orion Viewer you will need:
    android-sdk-r23+
    gradle 2.10+

    to compile native libs you also need
        android-ndk-r9d (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6849981/where-do-i-find-old-versions-of-android-ndk)
        git 1.9+
        linux make util for building mupdf 3rd party libs (cygwin or mingw for windows system)
    Note: compiled native libs could be downloaded by 'thirdparty_download.gradle' script

Thirdparty build scripted in 'thirdparty_build.gradle' file (details in 'orion-viewer/jni/README').
It should be executed once to build native libs.

Main project build logic scripted in build.gradle.

Specify path to android-sdk, android-ndk and folder to checkout third-party libs in 'local.properties'
(use 'local.properties.sample' as example).
